                   <h2>BMW 3 Series (E30)</h2>
               </header>

               <p>
                   The BMW E30 is a entry-level luxury car which was produced by BMW from 1982 to 1994. The initial models used the two-door sedan body style, and in following years the four-door sedan, convertible and estate ("touring") body styles were added.The E36 replaced the E30 in 1990, with E30 saloon production continuing into 1991. The cabriolet version continued to be built to the end of April 1993 and the touring version continued to be built to the end of June 1994.
                   The E30 models were powered by a range of four-cylinder and straight-six engines.
                   The BMW M3 was first introduced on the E30 platform. The E30 M3 was fitted with the high-revving BMW S14 four-cylinder petrol engine, which produced 175 kW (235 hp) in its final European-only iteration.
                   The 325iX model was the first 3 Series to use all-wheel drive.

                   <h2>Nissan Silvia</h2>
               </header>

               <p>
                   The Nissan Silvia is the name given to the company's long-running line of sport coupes based on the Nissan S platform. Although recent models have shared this chassis with other vehicles produced by Nissan (most notably the European 200SX and North American 240SX in the S13 and S14 generations, and 180SX in the Japanese market), the name Silvia is not interchangeable with the chassis codes. Nissan Silvia's main competitors worldwide are Honda Prelude, Mazda MX-6, Toyota Celica and Mitsubishi Eclipse, and in North America, the 240SX also competed against Acura Integra.
